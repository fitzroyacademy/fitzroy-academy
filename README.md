# High level stuff

The [Fitzroy Academy](https://fitzroyacademy.com) is an online social enterprise school. We create online courses and resources for entrepeneurs, educators and communities.

## What we're doing this year

In 2019 we are rebuilding the entire app, to replace the existing .com with a new app.

## Business goals + plans

We are minimally funded for 2019, with a focus on helping our partners achieve scale. High level goals include:

* Rebuild the app
* Internationalise the app, starting with Khmer for Cambodian partners
* Onboard + test app with 5-10K new users by end 2019
* Have resilient enterprise-level admin for our 'institutional' customers
* Better governance and reporting for our funders, partners, and customers
* New and more betterer billing + pricing structure

## Our values and policies

* [Core FA values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yxG_t3YyqWMZkBnVSjN-I9gKSnDiy5q78N4uGndV-2s/edit#): One page Google doc on how we roll
* [Code of conduct](https://fitzroyacademy.com/conduct): Our standards for behaviour;
* _We probably need more high level docs here? - WD_

# How we work

We are a small, quality, distributed team.

## People

We need more people:

* [Will Dayble](http://willdayble.com/): Project lead, full time, Melbourne, AU.
* **Reid Savage** Tech + devops, contract/part time, Cambridge, USA.
* **???** Backend dev?
* **???** Frontend dev?
* **???** Design + UX?
* **???** Customer support?
* **Prashant Raju** Data + analytics


## Accounts + logins

* We use Google accounts (name@fitzroyacademy.com) as our single point of control for most things.
* **Github** for code repos
* **Trello** for project management
* **Intercom** for user support

## Release process + project management

❗️ No freakin idea. HALP REID.

## Data + governance

### Data Philosophy:

* We aim to be [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/) compliant by default, whilst gathering _lots_ of data for teachers and institutions.
* We will have a public description of all data we collect from users
* Any user can download a (reasonable) copy of the data we have on them at any time
* Users can delete their data from our servers (in a way that doesn't break the app)

### Goals of data collection

1. Help teachers and institutes do better teaching
2. Better student learning experience
3. Help our team build better courses and lessons
4. Provide benchmarks for student activity to help program managers

# Operational + customer support:

* [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) for high level customer support.
* We need a support@ email thing...
