# High level stuff {#highlevel} ü•∞

The [Fitzroy Academy](https://fitzroyacademy.com) is an online social enterprise school. We create online courses and resources for entrepeneurs, educators and communities.

## What we're doing this year

In 2019 we are rebuilding the entire app, to replace the existing .com with a new app.

## Business goals + plans

We are minimally funded for 2019, with a focus on helping our partners achieve scale. High level goals include:

* Rebuild the app
* Internationalise the app, starting with Khmer for Cambodian partners
* Onboard + test app with 5-10K new users by end 2019
* Have resilient enterprise-level admin for our 'institutional' customers
* Better governance and reporting for our funders, partners, and customers
* New and more betterer billing + pricing structure

## Our values and policies

We're a social change org, so the detail on treating people fairly is _super_ important.

* [Core FA values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yxG_t3YyqWMZkBnVSjN-I9gKSnDiy5q78N4uGndV-2s/edit#): One page Google doc on our org-level values;
* [Code of conduct](https://fitzroyacademy.com/conduct): Our standards for behaviour;
* _We probably need more high level docs here? - WD_

# How we work {#how} üí¨

We are a tiny, high quality, distributed team.

## People

We need more people this year. Here's the tech team:

* [Will Dayble](http://willdayble.com/): Project lead + front end, full time, Melbourne, AU.
* **Reid** Tech + devops, contract/part time, Cambridge, USA.
* **???** Backend dev?
* **???** Frontend dev?
* **???** Design + UX?
* **???** Customer support?
* **Prashant Raju** Data + analytics


## Accounts + logins

* We use Google accounts (name@fitzroyacademy.com) as our single point of control for most things.
* **Github** for code repos
* **Trello** for project management
* **Intercom** for user support

## Release process + project management

‚ùóÔ∏è REID! HALP!

## Data + governance

### Data Philosophy:

* We aim to be [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/) compliant by default, whilst gathering _lots_ of data for teachers and institutions.
* We will have a public description of all data we collect from users
* Any user can download a (reasonable) copy of the data we have on them at any time
* Users can delete their data from our servers (in a way that doesn't break the app)

### Goals of data collection

1. Help teachers and institutes do better teaching
2. Better student learning experience
3. Help our team build better courses and lessons
4. Provide benchmarks for student activity to help program managers

## Operational + customer support

* [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) for high level customer support.
* **Todo:** We need a support@ email centralisation thing?

## Working with devs

We work remote, so we love devs who:

* Write simple, well commented, clear code;
* Use standard best practice, not hipster-level fashionable frameworks;
* Prefer to work remote than in an office;
* Are chilled out and easy to work with.

### Tools we use for development üõ†

We have a bias towards free, simple tools.

* [Github](https://www.github.com) for code
* [Appear.in](https://appear.in/fitzroyacademy) for video chat 
* [Trello](https://trello.com) for sprints + not forgetting things
* [Slack](https://www.slack.com) for text chat
* [Google docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) for writing things down that last

### How we pay devs:

* All devs work hour-by-hour;
* Most devs will have real jobs somewhere else (we can't afford full time staff);
* Devs report on how many hours done each month, and get paid via Paypal.

### How we onboard new devs:

* Speak to Will Dayble about what we need;
* Do a paid trial writing a few hours / a day-worth of code;
* If everyone's happy, agree to a rough expectation of hours / month and sally forth;

# The tech {#tech}

Now for the fun stuff, let's build an LMS.

## Context, UML stuff, etc 

‚ùóÔ∏è REID! HALP!

## Video provision

We use [Wistia](https://wistia.com/) for video hosting. Video is the most important part of the FA app.

## Frontend

Our big aim is to not reinvent the wheel, and use existing frameworks where possible.

* We use [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) as a basis for the app, because it's simple and because Will D is embarrassingly old-school.
* We use [Front by HTMLStream](http://bit.ly/front-template) for basic HTMLz

## Backend

‚ùóÔ∏è REID! HALP!

## DevOps: Hosting, CDN, etc.

‚ùóÔ∏è REID! HALP!
